## **Wiki:**
### Cleanser:
A facial cleanser is a skincare product used to remove make-up, dead skin cells, oil, dirt, and other types of pollutants from the skin, helping to keep pores clear and prevent skin conditions such as acne.

### Serum:
A serum is a concentrated liquid treatment that delivers topical ingredients to the skin in order to target concerns like wrinkles, discoloration and uneven texture. A serum is typically used before a moisturizer.

### Moisturizer:
A face moisturizer is a lotion, or cream emulsion, ointment or balm formulated with emollients that help skin stay hydrated. Moisturizers hydrate the surface layers of the skin. Their main skin benefit is that they seal the skin, locking in moisture and nutrients, while protecting the skin from environmental irritants.
