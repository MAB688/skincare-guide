                        When using cleanser, you want to be very gentle as to not irritate the skin which means you should not use anything but your clean hands. Follow these simple steps: <br>
                        1. Wet your face with warm water.<br>
                        2. Gently rub cleanser into your skin while being sure to not irritate your skin.<br>
                        3. Once you have thoroughly cleaned your skin, rinse your face with warm water.<br>
                        4. Finally, use a soft cloth and pat dry your skin.

                    <h4>
                        <br> Step 2 - Serum
                    </h4>
                    <h5>
                        After successfully cleansing your face, the next step in your skincare routine is serum. Follow these simple steps:<br>
                        1. Pump a small amount of serum in your hands and rub them together.<br>
                        2. Gently apply the serum to your skin in a circular motion and spend a little extra time in particularly problematic spots.<br>
                        3. Once you are done, allow the serum to dry. Do not rinse your skin or wipe it off.
                    </h5>
                    <h4>
                        <br> 3 - Moisturizer
                    </h4>
                    <h5>
                        Once the serum is dry, you can pump a good amount of moisturizer and gently rub it in to your skin. That's it, you have completed your skincare routine!
