                <div class="routine-Info">
                    <h5> 
                        Most types of acne essentially occur when hair follicles under the skin become clogged. Skin oil, Sebum, and dead skin cells cause clogging when they stick together instead of shedding, congesting the pore. Individuals of all races and ages can experience acne. <br>
                        <br> <strong>Blackheads:</strong> Caused by clogged hair follicles that are open once they reach the skin top; interaction with oxygen causes darker discoloration. <br>
                        <strong>Whiteheads:</strong> Caused by clogged hair follicle that stays under the skin, producing a white bump. <br>
                        <strong>Pimples:</strong> Inflamed lesions capped by white or yellow pus-filled lesions. <br>
                        <strong>Severe nodular acne or cystic acne:</strong> Deep, painful, pus-filled lesions. <br>
                        <br><strong> Important Ingredients:</strong> <br>
                        When looking for over-the-counter products to help your acne, the following ingredients benefit the breakdown of blackheads and whiteheads. Benzoyl peroxide kills bacteria and may decrease the production of sebum. Resorcinol may help breakdown blackheads and whiteheads. Salicylic acid helps break down blackheads and whiteheads, and helps reduce the shedding of cells lining the hair follicles. Sulfur helps break down blackheads and whiteheads. These ingredients can be found in cleansers, topical treatments or serums, and spot-treatment products.
