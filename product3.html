                        Moisturizers are lotions that keep your skin soft and hydrated throughout the day. It is an important step for people of all skin types, as cleansing your face removes moisture and aging reduces our ability to retain moisture. Some moisturizers also include built-in broad spectrum SPF to protect your skin from the sun during the day. This can make it easier to keep your skin safe without having to include an extra step in your routine.

                    <h5> 
                        The focus of moisturizers for dry skin should be locking in moisture from your serums and softening your skin. Heavier cream or lotion moisturizers advertised for dry skin are the best options. Some beneficial ingredients are hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and glycerin. Glycerin is a chemical that helps form a layer of moisture over your skin and prevents flaking. Hyaluronic acid and niacinamide can also be found in serums.<br>

                    <h5> 
                        The focus of moisturizers for oily skin should be to retain moisture while avoiding the overproduction of sebum. Lighter cream or lotion moisturizers advertised for oily skin are the best options. It is important to make sure your moisturizer is oil-free or non-comedogenic, which means it will not clog your pores.<br>

                        The focus of moisturizers for normal skin should be to retain moisture and keep your skin soft. For normal skin, the consistency of your moisturizer is not as important as it is for the other two skin types. Some beneficial ingredients are hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and glycerin. Glycerin is a chemical that helps form a layer of moisture over your skin and prevents flaking. Hyaluronic acid and niacinamide can also be found in serums. It is a good idea to make sure your moisturizer is oil-free or non-comedogenic, which means it will not clog your pores.<br>
